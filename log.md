### Thoughts

- While working on the Pokémon JavaScript Game (HTML Canvas) project, I made a mistake of not saving my "index.html" and "index.js" files. I was having issues displaying what I wrote on my code editor onto the opened index.html but the issue was that I wasn't saving the file for it to update.

### Thoughts

- Adding in the Pokemon JavaScript Game was a good change of pace. I have really been enjoying it.
 
- FreeCodeCamp designs their courses well. I feel like this is the most I have learnt in a while and their style of teaching is really encouraging. I have to build a tribute page and I plan to create one for Franco Columbu, my favorite bodybuilder!

## Day 16: July 09, 2022, Saturday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Responsive Web Design on [@freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/): 

- Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz. (59% → 100%)

[#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/):
- Started to provide updates to the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress.

Side Projects:
- Started Pokémon JavaScript Game (HTML Canvas) project.
- Still working on #Flutter application.  

### Thoughts

- After a week, I finally pushed myself to finish "Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz." Usually these courses do not take me this long to complete but this past week I have been feeling unmotivated. Today my friend suggested that I follow the [Pokémon JavaScript Game (HTML Canvas) Tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP5DKzriqXA) as a day project/challenge and now I feel as motivated as ever! 

- Today I also started logging my progress on Github and I feel like it will make me more accountable.
