## Day 17: July 10, 2022, Sunday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Responsive Web Design on [@freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/): 

- Tribute Page. (Started)

[#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/):
- Added to the (Log)[log.md] with addition information on previous DaysOfCode. 

Side Projects:
- Started Pokémon JavaScript Game (HTML Canvas) project. (1 Hour)
- Still working on #Flutter application.  

### Thoughts

- Adding in the Pokemon JavaScript Game was a good change of pace. I have really been enjoying it.
 
- FreeCodeCamp designs their courses well. I feel like this is the most I have learnt in a while and their style of teaching is really encouraging.

[#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/):
- Started to provide updates to the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress.

Side Projects:
- Started Pokémon JavaScript Game (HTML Canvas) project.
- Still working on #Flutter application.  

### Thoughts

- After a week, I finally pushed myself to finish "Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz." Usually these courses do not take me this long to complete but this past week I have been feeling unmotivated. Today my friend suggested that I follow the [Pokémon JavaScript Game (HTML Canvas) Tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP5DKzriqXA) as a day project/challenge and now I feel as motivated as ever! 

- Today I also started logging my progress on Github and I feel like it will make me more accountable.
